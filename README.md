# DofusLike

This project is more a protoype than anything else, but you can still find a build [here](https://github.com/Mystogan98/DofusLike/raw/master/DofusLike.zip)

Remember to play in windowed mode or you'll have to alt+F4 out of the game.

For now all you can do is click on the character and move it on a grid-based terrain. It feature a Djikstra and A* algorithm for movement and spell (not yet implemented).
This game actually has a lot of things done in the back-end, but barely anything front-end.
